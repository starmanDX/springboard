# React Testing Exercises

This exercise practices working with props, defaultProps, state, and simple click events in React.

## Carousel Component

You’ve been given a React App containing an image carousel. The app contains a couple of components, and a single test file.

### Part 1: Demo the App & Read the Code

Start the app and play around with the image carousel. Sketch out the component hierarchy and make sure you understand what’s going on. Which components have state, and how does that state get changed?

You may find bugs as you’re exploring the app. Don’t fix them yet!

### Part 2: Smoke and Snapshot tests

The Card and Carousel components don’t have any smoke or snapshot tests. Write one of each type of test for each component.

### Part 3: Bug! Left arrow

As you may have noticed, the left arrow and the right arrow both do the same thing: move to the next image in the image array. Write a (failing) test that checks for this bug. In other words, write a test that expects that when you’re on the second image, clicking the left arrow will move you to the first image. Once you’ve written a failing test, fix the app so that your test turns green.

### Part 4: Bug! Exhausting the image array

As you may have noticed, if you’re on the last image and try to move forward, or if you’re on the first image and try to move backward, you get an error. To fix this, let’s just hide the left arrow on the first image and the right arrow on the last.

Write a (failing) test to check that the left arrow is missing when you’re on the first image, and that the right arrow is missing when you’re on the last image. Then fix the bug so that your test turns green.

## Further Study: Coin Flip

Make a new React project with create-react-app, and make Git repositories so you can save your work.

For this part, you will create a coin flipping counter.

The user should be able to click on a button to flip a coin. Every time the user clicks, the coin gets flipped again. The app should also keep track of how many times heads and tails have shown up.

Before building anything, think about the structure of your React app. Don’t build this application with a single component: think about how to break your app up into at least two separate components!

### Tests

Write tests for your application as well. At a minimum, you should test that there’s no coin image when the page loads, and that the text below the coin updates properly when the coin lands on heads or tails.

Note: Testing Randomness

    Testing random output can be tricky, since it’s unpredictable. Fortunately, Jest comes with functionality to mock any function you like, including Math.random. One way to handle it is with code like this:

        beforeEach(function() {
        jest
            .spyOn(Math, "random")
            .mockReturnValueOnce(0.25)
            .mockReturnValueOnce(0.75);
        });

        afterEach(function() {
        Math.random.mockRestore();
        });

    With this code, Jest will ensure that the first call to Math.random() returns 0.25, and the second call will return 0.75. In this way you can make random output completely predictable within your tests.
