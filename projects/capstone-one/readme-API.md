## API - Smartable AI's COVID-19 Stats and News API
### Website

https://developer.smartable.ai/api-details#api=coronavirus&operation=news

### About

"Our free COVID-19 Stats and New API lets you send a web-based query to Smartable AI and get back details about global and regional coronavirus data, including latest numbers, historic values, and geo-breakdowns. It is the same API that powers our popular COVID-19 stats pages. Developers can take the returned information and display it in their own tools, apps and visualizations. Different from other coronavirus data sources that produce breaking changes from time to time, our API strives to be stable, detailed and close to real-time, by leveraging AI to gather information from many credible sources. With a few clicks in our API try-it experience, developers can get it running quickly and unleash their creativity."
