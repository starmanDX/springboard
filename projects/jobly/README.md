Jobly
Download exercise

This is a longer exercise to practice Node, Express, and PostgreSQL with relationships. In it, you’ll build “Jobly”, a job searching and connecting API.

Goals & Requirements

All of your responses should be in JSON. Use Insonmia or curl to test your API.
Be thoughtful about function and variable names, and for you to write appropriate documentation for every function and route.
After each section, we expect you to write tests for the routes in that section.
For each resource, place all of your SQL/database logic in a class. We do not want to see ANY SQL in your routes!
Part One: Setup / Starter Code
Setup:

Create a project folder, Git repository, and package.json
Install the libraries needed
Starter Code:

For PATCH routes that need to “partially update” a database object, we’ve provided a useful helper function in partialUpdate.js. Read the code and documentation and figure out what it will be useful for.

Write a unit test for this function.

Part Two: Companies
Create a table for companies, each company should have a:

handle: a primary key that is text
name: a non-nullable column that is text and unique
num_employees: a column that is an integer
description: a column that is text
logo_url: a column that is text
Routes
Create an API that has the following five routes:

GET /companies
This should return the handle and name for all of the company objects. It should also allow for the following query string parameters

search. If the query string parameter is passed, a filtered list of handles and names should be displayed based on the search term and if the name includes it.
min_employees. If the query string parameter is passed, titles and company handles should be displayed that have a number of employees greater than the value of the query string parameter.
max_employees. If the query string parameter is passed, a list of titles and company handles should be displayed that have a number of employees less than the value of the query string parameter.
If the min_employees parameter is greater than the max_employees parameter, respond with a 400 status and a message notifying that the parameters are incorrect.
This should return JSON of {companies: [companyData, ...]}

POST /companies
This should create a new company and return the newly created company.

This should return JSON of {company: companyData}

GET /companies/[handle]
This should return a single company found by its id.

This should return JSON of {company: companyData}

PATCH /companies/[handle]
This should update an existing company and return the updated company.

This should return JSON of {company: companyData}

DELETE /companies/[handle]
This should remove an existing company and return a message.

This should return JSON of {message: "Company deleted"}

Validation and Testing
For your POST and PATCH methods, you should validate the provided data with the JSON schema validator.

Add tests for each route you created in this section.

Part Three: Jobs
Before you continue, make sure you have completed the exercises in the previous sections. This exercise builds off of the previous exercise.

Add a table for jobs, each job should have an:

id: a primary key that is an auto incrementing integer
title: a non-nullable column
salary a non-nullable floating point column
equity: a non-nullable column that is a float. For example, 0.5 equity represents 50% in a company. Ensure that you have a constraint that does not allow for equity to be greater than 1 when created.
company_handle: a column which is a foreign key to the handle column
date_posted: a datetime column that defaults to whenever the row is created
The jobs table has a one to many relationship with companies which means there is a foreign key in the jobs table that references the companies table. In this relationship, one company has many jobs, and each job belongs to a single company.

Make sure then when a company is deleted, all of the jobs associated with that company are deleted also.

New Routes
Make sure your application has the following routes:

POST /jobs
This route creates a new job and returns a new job.

It should return JSON of {job: jobData}

GET /jobs
This route should list all the titles and company handles for all jobs, ordered by the most recently posted jobs. It should also allow for the following query string parameters

search: If the query string parameter is passed, a filtered list of titles and company handles should be displayed based on the search term and if the job title includes it.
min_salary: If the query string parameter is passed, titles and company handles should be displayed that have a salary greater than the value of the query string parameter.
min_equity: If the query string parameter is passed, a list of titles and company handles should be displayed that have an equity greater than the value of the query string parameter.
It should return JSON of {jobs: [job, ...]}

GET /jobs/[id]
This route should show information about a specific job including a key of company which is an object that contains all of the information about the company associated with it.

It should return JSON of {job: jobData}

PATCH /jobs/[id]
This route updates a job by its ID and returns an the newly updated job.

It should return JSON of {job: jobData}

DELETE /jobs/[id]
This route deletes a job and returns a message.

It should return JSON of { message: "Job deleted" }

Update Routes from Part One
Update the following routes:

GET /companies/[handle]
This should return a single company found by its id. It should also return a key of jobs which is an array of jobs that belong to that company: {company: {...companyData, jobs: [job, ...]}}
Validation and Testing
For your POST and PATCH methods, you should validate the provided data with the JSON schema validator.

Add tests for each route you created in this section.

Part Four: Users
Create a table for users, each user should have a:

username: a primary key that is text
password: a non-nullable column
first_name: a non-nullable column
last_name: a non-nullable column
email: a non-nullable column that is and unique
photo_url: a column that is text
is_admin: a column that is not null, boolean and defaults to false
Routes
Create an API that has the following five routes:

POST /users
This should create a new user and return information on the newly created user.

This should return JSON: {user: user}

GET /users
This should return the username, first_name, last_name and email of the user objects.

This should return JSON: {users: [{username, first_name, last_name, email}, ...]}

GET /users/[username]
This should return all the fields for a user excluding the password.

This should return JSON: {user: {username, first_name, last_name, email, photo_url}}

PATCH /users/[username]
This should update an existing user and return the updated user excluding the password.

This should return JSON: {user: {username, first_name, last_name, email, photo_url}}

DELETE /users/[username]
This should remove an existing user and return a message.

This should return JSON: { message: "User deleted" }

Validation and Testing
For your POST and PATCH methods, you should validate the provided data with the JSON schema validator.

Add tests for each route you created in this section.

Part Five: Authentication / Authorization
Add the following route:

POST /login
This should authenticate a user and return a JSON Web Token which contains a payload with the username and is_admin values.

This should return JSON: {token: token}

Change the following route:

POST /users
This should create a new user and return a JWT which includes the username and whether or not the user is an admin.

This should return JSON: {token: token}

Protect the following routes and make sure only a user who has authenticated in can use them:

GET /jobs
GET /jobs/[id]
GET /companies
GET /companies/[handle]
Protect the following routes and make sure they are only accessible by the logged-in user with the same username:

PATCH /users/[username]
DELETE /users/[username]
Protect the following routes and make sure they are only accessible by a user who is an admin:

POST /companies
POST /jobs
PATCH /companies/[handle]
DELETE /companies/[handle]
PATCH /jobs/[id]
DELETE /jobs/[id]
Further Study
Before you continue, make sure you have completed all the parts above.

Job Applications
Create a table called applications which will contain the following columns:

username: a primary key that is a foreign key to the username column in the users table
job_id: a primary key that is a foreign key to the id column in the jobs table
state: a non-nullable column that is text
created_at: a datetime column that defaults to when the row was created
It should update the following routes:

GET /users/[username]
This should show all the fields for a user excluding the password. It should also include a column of jobs which are all of the jobs that user is associated with as well as the status of that application.
It should add a route:

POST /jobs/[id]/apply
This should take {state: string-of-application-state} and insert into the applications table. It should return JSON of {message: new-state}.
Add Technologies for Jobs
Add a table for technologies which is a many to many with jobs (a job can require “Python” and “JavaScript”, and these technologies could be linked to many jobs).

Add Technologies for Users
Make the technologies table a many to many with users as well and create an endpoint that matches users with jobs where the technologies are the same.

Use enum Type
Research PostgreSQL’s enum types and change the state column in the applications table to be an enum that consists of ‘interested’, ‘applied’, ‘accepted’, ‘rejected’.

Continuous Integration
Do some more reading on Travis CI, and configure the project to use it.
